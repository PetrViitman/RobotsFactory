# RobotsFactory
A small puzzle game made with unity

GAMEPLAY

Player sorts the given table of 3x3 cells by sliding columns and rows. The 
offsetting cells are always brought on the opposite side of table.

GAME FLOW

Player needs to solve [N] or more puzzles (sort [N] or more tables) before time is 
out. Each time player solves a puzzle, the award score is earned.
If time is out and the number of earned scores is more or equal to [N], then 
process repeats, puzzles become harder and scores decrement by [N], otherwise 
all progress is lost and the game starts from the very beginning.
PLOT
The evil ghost of a great hunger is sleeping, but when it awakes, you better have 
enough robots to feed it, or the world is undone. Therefore, hurry up and 
assemble as many robots as possible to make it sleep again.
